# RideGreen by Team AirHeads

A HackTech Project by Edward, Terry, and Pat

This mobile application enables students who attend a common college campus to find other students to carpool with, in the interest of increasing ease and therefore frequency of ridesharing amongst college students. This is meant to cut down the amount of fuel used in student transportation, thereby enhancing the interests of sustainability.

This application consists of a SwiftUI frontend, combined with a Firebase backend for storing user data and matching commuters.

The app is built using CocoaPods, a tool for downloading relevant dependancies into SwiftUI frameworks. This allows ease of use of Firebase API to connect to the IOS+ Dev environment.

The database is formatted as a tree which can be searched first by location and then by date to deliver a matching ride request to a user who wants to rideshare with another.

In future releases, this app will be upgraded to use Firebase Authentication UI to increase the user-specific features and enable in-app messaging.
