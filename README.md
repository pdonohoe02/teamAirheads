A HackTech Project by Edward, Terry, and Pat

This mobile application enables students who attend a common college campus to find other students to carpool with, in the interest of increasing ease and therefore frequency of ridesharing amongst college students. This is meant to cut down the amount of fuel used in student transportation, thereby enhancing the interests of sustainability.

This application consists of a SwiftUI frontend, combined with a Firebase backend for storing user data and matching commuters.
